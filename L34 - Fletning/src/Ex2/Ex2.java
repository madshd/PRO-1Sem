Exercise 2
In this exercise you are going to merge two arrays containing integers.
a) Program the following method in the method class:
/**
* Return a sorted array containing all elements
* shared by l1 and l2.
* The returned array must have no empty entries.
* Pre: l1 and l2 are sorted and have no empty entries.
*/
/*
public static int[] sharedNumbers (int[] l1, int[] l2)
b) Create two arrays in the main() method (perhaps {2,4,6,8,10,12,14} and
{1,2,4,5,6,9,12,17}).
c) Use the method sharedNumbers() with the two arrays and print the result. (With the two
arrays above the result will be {2,4,6,12}).
