Exercise 1
In this exercise you are going to merge two lists of Customer objects.
a) Make a Customer class that implements Comparable<Customer>. Customers are ordered
by last name and then first name.
b) Program the following method (use a total merging) in a class with a main() method:
/**
* Return a sorted list containing all customers
* from the lists l1 and l2.
* Pre: l1 and l2 are sorted.
*/
/*
public static ArrayList<Customer> mergeAllCustomers (
        ArrayList<Customer> l1, ArrayList<Customer> l2) {...}
c) Test the method mergeAllCustomers() in the main() method (remember that the lists used
        as parameters must be sorted).
