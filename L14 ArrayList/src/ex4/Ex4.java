/*
Make an Ex4Test class with a main() method and add the following methods to the class (they
all take an ArrayList<Integer> as parameter):
• A method that switches the first and last element in the ArrayList (assume size >= 1).
• A method that replaces all even numbers with 0 (zero).
• A method that returns the second highest element in the ArrayList (assume size >= 2).
• A method that returns true if the elements in the ArrayList are sorted ascending.
• A method that shifts all elements in the array to the right (to an index one higher). The
last element is shifted to the first index in the ArrayList (assume size >= 1).
Example: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25} is changed to {25, 1, 4, 9, 16}
• A method that returns true if the ArrayList has doublets.
Example: true is returned for {2, 5, 8, 5}, false is returned for {2, 5, 8, 6}.
Test the methods in the main() method.
