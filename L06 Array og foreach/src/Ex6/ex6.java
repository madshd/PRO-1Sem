package Ex6;
/*
Make an Ex7Test class with a main() method and add the following methods to the class (they
all take an int array as parameter):
• A method that switches the first and last element in the array.
• A method that replaces all even numbers with 0 (zero).
• A method that returns the second highest element in the array.
• A method that returns true if the elements in the array are sorted ascending.
• A method that shifts all elements in the array to the right (to an index one higher). The
last element is shifted to the first index in the array.
Example: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25} is changed to {25, 1, 4, 9, 16}
• A method that returns true if the array has doublets.
Example: true is returned for {2, 5, 8, 5}, false is returned for {2, 5, 8, 6}.
Test your methods in main().
